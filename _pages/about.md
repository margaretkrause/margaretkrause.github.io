Thanks for stopping by! I am a Minnesota native currently based in Mexico, where I am a [United States National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow in Biology](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503622) at the [International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center](https://cimmyt.org/). I'm excited about wheat and making it better. Check out my Home page to see what I'm up to.
